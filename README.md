# DIA -Investigating desirability of boid like behaviours in a predator/prey simulation


## Behaviour videos


random movement.mp4  
Demonstrates the first behaviour state in the chromosome  


boid movement.mp4  
Demonstrates the second behaviour state in the chromosome  


Return movement.mp4  
Demonstrates the third behaviour state in the chromosome  


Wolf hunting behaviour.mp4  
Demonstrates the behaviour of the wolf  

## Graphs and figures

Visualised_ranges.png  
Demonstrates visually the unit ranges talked about in my paper  

## Project
The project should be opened through unity, and is not exported as an executable, hyperparameters need to be set in the engine.
The majority of hyperparameters are found in the scripts labelled "behaviour_controller" and "spawner".
Prey and predator vision is controlled through the prefab for the respective agent.
